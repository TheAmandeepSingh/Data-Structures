/**
 *                                  Intersection of two arrays
 * There are two variants of this problem:
 * 1) Resulting array should have unique numbers
 * e.g. Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
 *      Output: [2]
 * 2) Resulting array should have elements as many times they appear in both arrays
