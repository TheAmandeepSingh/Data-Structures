# Data Structures

Hello there!
This is my implementation of various data structures. I will keep adding here every week until I cover all types.


## Heap
Two types of heap:

 1. Max Heap
 2. Min Heap

### Max Heap
A max heap is a tree-like data structure where the parent is always greater than its children.

e.g. let's take an array of numbers
		100   75	 95	 60	 65	 90

## Graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred 
to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
  		
		    0 ------ 1
                |        | \
                |        |  \
                4 ------ 3---2

In the above Graph, the set of vertices V = {0,1,2,3,4} and the set of edges E = {01, 12, 23, 34, 04, 14, 13}.
 
The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph. 
 1. Adjacency Matrix
 2. Adjacency List

## Linked List
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.
It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

There are three types of linked list:
 1. Singly linked list
 2. Doubly linked List
 3. Circular linked list

 ### Singly Linked List
 A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

 ### Doubly Linked List
 A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

 ### Circular Linked List
 A Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.
