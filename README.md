# Data Structures

Hello there!
This is my implementation of various data structures. I will keep adding here every week until I cover all types.


## Heap
Two types of heap:

 1. Max Heap
 2. Min Heap

### Max Heap
A max heap is a tree-like data structure where the parent is always greater than its children. Here is an implementation of Max Heap from scratch. Let me know if it helped.

e.g. let's take an array of numbers
		100   75	 95	 60	 65	 90

## Graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred 
to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
  				0 ------ 1
                |        | \
                |        |  \
                4 ------ 3---2

In the above Graph, the set of vertices V = {0,1,2,3,4} and the set of edges E = {01, 12, 23, 34, 04, 14, 13}.
 
The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph. 
 1. Adjacency Matrix
 2. Adjacency List
