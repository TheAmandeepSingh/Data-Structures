 * A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred 
 * to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
 * 
 * More formally, a Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

 *                  4 ------ 3---2
 * 
 * In the above Graph, the set of vertices V = {0,1,2,3,4} and the set of edges E = {01, 12, 23, 34, 04, 14, 13}.
 * 
 * The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph. 
    1. Adjacency Matrix 
    2. Adjacency List
